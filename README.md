Steg:You are to write one program that implements both the bit and byte methods of storing
and retrieving the hidden data (more on this below). The sentinel value will be the six
bytes 0x0 0xff 0x0 0x0 0xff 0x0 appended to the hidden data. After careful thought,
let’s agree to store the bit data from left-to-right. Note that you should be able to alter your
program at a later time (e.g., during Cyber Storm) to store the bit data from right-to-left.
